    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Python logging module defines five levels of logging, listed in increasing order of severity :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) DEBUG : Detailed information for debugging purposes. This level is typically used to provide detailed information about the\n",
    "    execution flow, variable values, or other relevant details during development and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) INFO : General information about the program's execution. This level is used to confirm that certain events or milestones \n",
    "    have occurred. It provides information that can be helpful for understanding the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) WARNING : Indicates potentially unexpected or problematic situations that do not necessarily prevent the program from\n",
    "    running but might require attention. This level is often used to highlight conditions that could lead to errors or\n",
    "    unexpected behavior in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) ERROR : Indicates errors or exceptions that were caught during the program's execution. These errors might affect the\n",
    "    normal flow of the program or indicate incorrect behavior, but they don't cause the program to terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) CRITICAL : The most severe level of logging. It indicates critical errors or failures that might cause the program to crash\n",
    "    or cannot be recovered from. This level is typically used for exceptional or catastrophic events that require immediate \n",
    "    attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the logging level is set to WARNING, so only messages with WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL levels (or higher) will be\n",

    "Ques 8.) Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for displaying messages in software for \n",
    "the following reasons :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Log Levels and Granularity : The logging module provides different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) \n",
    "    that allow us to control the verbosity of our log output. This granularity enables us to log messages at different \n",
    "    levels depending on their importance or severity. In contrast, print() statements lack this built-in granularity, and we \n",
    "    need to manually add conditional checks or comment out print() statements to control the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Flexibility and Configurability : The logging module offers extensive flexibility and configurability. We can easily\n",
    "    adjust the log output format, specify output destinations (such as files or streams), configure log rotation, and integrate\n",
    "    with external log analysis tools. With print() statements, we have limited control over the output format and cannot easily\n",
    "    redirect or manage the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Runtime Enable/Disable : Logging allows us to enable or disable specific log levels or log messages dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "    This can be extremely useful in production environments to control the verbosity of log output without modifying the code.\n",
    "    On the other hand, print() statements are static and cannot be easily toggled on or off without code modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Integration with Logging Frameworks : The logging module integrates well with various logging frameworks and libraries, \n",
    "    such as log aggregators, log analyzers, or monitoring tools. These tools provide advanced features for log analysis,\n",
    "    search, and monitoring. Integrating print() statements with such tools would require additional customizations and parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Structured Logging : The logging module supports structured logging, allowing us to log structured data along with our \n",
    "    messages. This makes it easier to analyze and filter logs based on specific fields or criteria. With print() statements,\n",
    "    we can manually format and concatenate the data, making it harder to extract specific information from the log output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using the logging module provides more flexibility, configurability, and control over our log output, making it a \n",
    "preferred choice over print() statements for logging and debugging purposes."

    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are commonly found in debugging environments and serve different purposes during\n",
    "program execution. Here are the differences between these buttons :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Step Over : The Step Over button allows us to execute the current line of code and move to the next line in the program. \n",
    "    If the current line contains a function call, Step Over will execute the entire function without stepping into it. This is\n",
    "    useful when we want to quickly move through a function call without delving into its internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Step In : The Step In button allows us to step into the current line of code and enter a function call. If the current\n",
    "    line contains a function call, Step In will pause program execution and take us inside the called function. This allows\n",
    "    us to debug and examine the code within the function, line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Step Out : The Step Out button is used to execute the remaining lines of the current function and return to the caller. It\n",
    "    is typically used when we want to quickly jump out of a function and continue execution from the point where the function \n",
    "    was called. Step Out is helpful when we are inside a function and want to skip over the remaining code and return to the \n",
    "    higher-level context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the Step Over button executes the current line and moves to the next line, the Step In button enters a function \n",
    "call and allows for debugging within the called function, and the Step Out button executes the remaining lines of the current\n",
    "function and returns to the caller. These buttons provide control and flexibility when debugging our program, allowing us to\n",
    "step through the code and examine its behavior."

    "\n",
    "1.) Breakpoint : If there is a breakpoint set in the code, the debugger will stop when it reaches the line of code associated\n",

    "    expressions, and analyze the program's state at that specific point.\n",

    "3.) Program Completion : The debugger will stop when the program execution is completed, reaching the end of the script or the\n",

    "    state at any desired moment.\n",

    "In the context of debugging, a breakpoint is a designated point in our code where the debugger pauses program execution to \n",
    "allow for inspection, analysis, and debugging activities. It is a debugging tool that helps us examine the program's state \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Breakpoints serve several purposes :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Inspecting Variables : By pausing the program's execution at a specific line, we can inspect the values of variables, \n",
    "    check their state, and identify any unexpected behavior or incorrect values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Stepping Through Code : Breakpoints allow us to step through the code line by line, using step-by-step execution commands \n",

    "    behavior of specific sections of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Debugging Specific Issues : Breakpoints are useful for debugging specific issues or problematic sections of code. By \n",
    "    setting breakpoints at strategic locations, we can focus our debugging efforts on those areas and narrow down the scope\n",
    "    of investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Dynamic Control : Breakpoints provide a means to dynamically control program execution during debugging. We can set or \n",
    "    remove breakpoints as needed, enabling us to pause and resume execution at specific points of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakpoints are typically set within an integrated development environment (IDE) or a dedicated debugging tool. The exact \n",
